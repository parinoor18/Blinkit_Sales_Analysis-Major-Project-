In today’s fast-paced digital economy, data-driven decision-making is essential for businesses seeking to optimize their operations and maximize revenue. This project, “Grocery Sales Analysis using Microsoft Power BI,” aims to develop an interactive business intelligence dashboard that provides valuable insights into sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and outlet efficiency.

The core objective of this project is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard will integrate Blinkit grocery sales data, apply ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and leverage DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs). The result will be an intuitive and visually engaging platform that allows users to explore sales trends, product demand, and customer satisfaction metrics.

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a detailed overview of the project, including functional requirements, system architecture, data flow, and user interaction elements. The document outlines the technologies used, system constraints, and future enhancements, such as real-time data integration and predictive analytics.

The Power BI dashboard developed in this project will help businesses monitor sales trends, compare product performances, and identify areas for improvement, ultimately driving better business strategies and operational efficiency. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how business intelligence tools can be leveraged to gain a competitive edge in the retail industry.

This work is a culmination of extensive research, data analysis, and practical application of Power BI's capabilities to deliver a solution that aligns with modern data analytics standards. I sincerely hope that this project contributes to the growing field of business intelligence and data visualization, helping organizations harness the power of data for strategic decision-making.
